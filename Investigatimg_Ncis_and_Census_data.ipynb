    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: In this section of the report, provide a brief introduction to the dataset you've selected/downloaded for analysis. Read through the description available on the `Project Details` page of `Investigate a Dataset` lesson for this course. List all column names in each table, and their significance. In case of multiple tables, describe the relationship between tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives.\n",
    "Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isn’t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase.\n",
    "The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov(opens in a new tab).\n",
    "- The NICS data(opens in a new tab) is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.\n",
    "- The U.S. census data(opens in a new tab) is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (2016), but a few have data for more than one year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    ">**Tip**: Clearly state one or more questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. You will address these questions in the **data analysis** and **conclusion** sections. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: Once you start coding, use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Also, **use good coding practices**, such as, define and use functions to avoid repetitive code. Use appropriate comments within the code cells, explanation in the mark-down cells, and meaningful variable names. \n",

    "What census data is most associated with high gun per capita? Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations? What is the overall trend of gun purchases?"

One option that you can take with this project is to do a lot of explorations initially. This does not have to be organized, but make sure you use enough comments to understand the purpose of each code cell. Then, after you're done with your analysis, trim the excess and organize your steps so that you have a flowing, cohesive report."

You should compute the relevant statistics throughout the analysis when an inference is made about the data. Note that at least two or more kinds of plots should be created as part of the exploration, and you must  compare and show trends in the varied visualizations. Remember to utilize the visualizations that the pandas library already has available.\n",

Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables. You should explore at least three variables in relation to the primary question. This can be an exploratory relationship between three variables of interest, or looking at how two independent variables relate to a single dependent variable of interest. Lastly, you  should perform both single-variable (1d) and multiple-variable (2d) explorations.\n",
